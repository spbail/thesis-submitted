LaTeX Motivator ++

version 0.1 alpha

Based on Bijan Parsia's LaTeX count script.

Author: SP Bail, bails@cs.man.ac.uk

Install: Copy all scripts into the directory with your LaTeX file (I'll sort this asap!)

Run: python latex-motivator.py

Setup: python latex-motivator.py --setup

The script generates and updates a CSV file with all wordcounts, so if you feel like plotting your progress, feel free to do so.
