	Volume = 75,
	Year = 1995,
	Abstract = {A well-known result of Ladner says that the satisfiability problem
        for K45, KD45, and S5 is NP-complete. This result implicitly assumes
        that there are infinitely many primitive propositions in the language;
        it is easy to see that the satisfiability problem for these logics
        becomes linear time if there are only finitely many primitive propositions
        in the language. By way of contrast, we show that the PSPACE-completeness
        results of Ladner and Halpem and Moses hold for the modal logics
        Kn, Tn, S4n, n >= 1, and K45n, KD45n, S5n, n >= 2, even if there
        is only one primitive proposition in the language. We go on to examine
        the effect on complexity of bounding the depth of nesting of modal
        operators. If we restrict to finite nesting, then the satisfiability
        problem is NP-complete for all the modal logics considered, but S4.
        If we then further restrict the language to having only finitely
        many primitive propositions, the complexity goes down to linear time
        in all cases.}}

	Volume = {23},
	Year = {1999},
	Abstract = {Information systems with an "intelligent" or "knowledge" component are now prevalent and include knowledge-based systems, decision support systems, intelligent agents, and knowledge management systems. These systems are in principle capable of explaining their reasoning or justifying their behavior. There appears to be a lack of understanding, however, of the benefits that can flow from explanation use, and how an explanation function should be constructed. Work with newer types of intelligent systems and help functions for everyday systems, such as word-processors, appears in many cases to neglect lessons learned in the past. This paper attempts to rectify this situation by drawing together the considerable body of work on the nature and use of explanations. Empirical studies, mainly with knowledge-based systems, are reviewed and linked to a sound theoretical base. The theoretical base combines a cognitive effort perspective, cognitive learning theory, and Toulmin's model of argumentation. Conclusions drawn from the review have both practical and theoretical significance. Explanations are important to users in a number of circumstances-when the user perceives an anomaly, when they want to learn, or when they need a specific piece of knowledge to participate properly in problem solving. Explanations, when suitably designed, have been shown to improve performance and learning and result in more positive user perceptions of a system. The design is important, however, because it appears that explanations will not be used if the user has to exert "too much" effort to get them. Explanations should be provided automatically if this can be done relatively unobtrusively, or by hypertext links, and should be context-specific rather than generic. Explanations that conform to Toulmin's model of argumentation, in that they provide adequate justification for the knowledge offered, should be more persuasive and lead to greater trust, agreement, satisfaction, and acceptance-of the explanation and possibly also of the system as a whole.},

- Bug in Reiter's HST algorithm: basic algorithm for constructing a HST is correct, but pruning can result in incomplete diagnosis 
- possible to lose minimal hitting sets (and therefore diagnoses)
- problem arises from combination of pruning rule that removes redundant edges and closing rules

Background
- Conflict set: set {c1...ck} that make the system inconsistent
- Diagnosis: Minimal set (subset of components) such that all c in the set make the system inconsistent
--> Diagnosis is a minimal hitting set for the collection of conflict sets
- wrt HST: sets in the collection that are used as node labels are conflict sets (are calculated as needed by theorem prover)

Key ideas / Methodology
- Corrected algorithm constructs Hitting Set DAG to compute minimal hitting sets rather than HST through changes in pruning methodology
- uses ordered collection of sets

Technical contribution
- correction to Reiter's HST algorithm and proof of correctness of HS-DAG algorithm

Conclusion / Evaluation
- 

Technical flaws
 - 

Comparison to other work
- correction of Reiter's HST algorithm
- which version is used by Schlobach?

Relevance to your work
- HST algorithm relates to finding justifications

	Volume = {3},
	Year = {2005},
	Abstract = {As an increasingly large number of OWL ontologies become available on the Semantic Web and the descriptions in the ontologies become more complicated, finding the cause of errors becomes an extremely hard task even for experts. Existing ontology development environments provide some limited support, in conjunction with a reasoner, for reporting errors in OWL ontologies. Typically, these are restricted to the mere detection of, for example, unsatisfiable concepts. However, the diagnosis and resolution of the bug is not supported at all. For example, no explanation is given as to why the error occurs (e.g., by pinpointing the root clash, or axioms in the ontology responsible for the clash) or how dependencies between classes cause the error to propagate (i.e., by distinguishing root from derived unsatisfiable classes). In the former case, information from the internals of a description logic tableaux reasoner can be extracted and presented to the user (glass box approach); while in the latter case, the reasoner can be used as an oracle for a certain set of questions and the asserted structure of the ontology can be used to help isolate the source of the problems (black box approach). Based on the two approaches, we have integrated a number of debugging cues generated from our reasoner, Pellet, in our hypertextual ontology development environment, Swoop. A conducted usability evaluation demonstrates that these debugging cues significantly improve the OWL debugging experience, and point the way to more general improvements in the presentation of an ontology to users.},
	Annote = {Problem statement /Motivation
- Focuses on unsatisfiable concepts and contradictory ABoxes


Background
- Explanation support encourages user to experiment with complex expressions
- OWL ontologies have three main modelling defects
1) syntactic
2) semantic
3) modelling defects
--> Work on a "Sympton ontology" to represent errors and warnings caused by defects

Key ideas / Methodology
- present glass box (modifications in tableaux reasoner) and black box methods
- "sets of support" = MUPS
- find COMMON sets of support - cause inconsistency for large number of related classes (difficult to achieve with glass box)
--> explore black box, differentiate between root and derived unsatisfiable classes
- repair: fix root unsatisfiable classes first
- Inferred dependency detection difficult due to masking of subsumption relationships

Technical contribution
- Explanation support in SWOOP editor: Suite of features that detect clashes/sets of support axioms and identifies root/derived unsatisfiable classes
- Definition of root & derived unsatisfiable classes, dependency-detection algorithm

Conclusion / Evaluation
- Performance tests on 5 ontologies: dependency tracking only increases processing time marginally
- Usability tests with 12 users, divided into 4 groups with different levels of support (no support, clash information and sets of support axioms, root/derived, both)
- users describe features as helpful

Technical flaws
 - 

Comparison to other work
- extension of www05 paper

Relevance to your work
- extended definitions of root / derived

What questions does it raise?

	Year = {2009},
	Annote = {Problem statement /Motivation
- assess quality of evolving ontologies by measuring their cohesiveness
- measure ontologies with semantic inconsistencies
- based on semantic cohesion metrics

Background
- axiom fanouts

Key ideas / Methodology
- take into account semantics of ontology (subsumption)
- measure ontology inconsistency
- metrics:
1) Average Axiom Fanouts per Class (AAFC)
2) Number of Minimally Inconsistent Subsets (NMIS)
3) Average Value of Axiom Inconsistencies (AVAI)
- use metrics for repair

Technical contribution
- three different metrics that are stable wrt the semantics
- drastic inconsistency value (1: inconsistent or 0: consistent)
- inconsistency impact value of axiom

Conclusion / Evaluation
- validation using Kitchenham's and Briand's frameworks
- result: metrics satisfy cohesion properties
- empirical validation: prototype implementation (using KAON) of metrics and algorithms
- 19 evaluators to rate cohesiveness of ontology
- results: metrics have large correlation with evaluator's ratings

Technical flaws
 - 

Comparison to other work
- 

Relevance to your work
- can metrics be applied to justifications?

What questions does it raise?
- stable wrt what? What happens when adding axioms, reasoning etc?

	Annote = {Problem statement /Motivation
- observed behaviour of a system differs from correct system behaviour ( -> diagnostic problem)
- faulty components of a system have to be diagnosed

Background
- diagnosis from first principles: description of (correct system) + observation of (faulty) system behaviour -> determine which components cause the errors

Key ideas / Methodology
- describe the system in a logic (FOL, but generalisation also holds)
- no heuristic information about system failures available, only system description and observation
- conflict set: set of components such that assuming that all elements of the set are correct leads to a contradiction 
	(i.e. combination of all components in the conflict set causes an error in the system)
- hitting set: set H of components such that for each conflict set S the intersection of H and S is not empty
	(i.e. for each conflict set S, the hitting set H contains at least one element from S)
- diagnosis: minimal hitting set for the collection of conflict sets for a system
- compute minimal hitting sets using a hitting set tree
- multiple diagnoses for one system possible

Technical contribution
- provides theoretical foundation and definition for diagnosis from first principles
- defines the concept of a diagnosis (minimal subset of components that are faulty, while the rest is correct)
- algorithm to compute all hitting sets and therefore diagnoses (single fault and multiple fault)

Conclusion / Evaluation
- diagnosis is a form of non monotonic reasoning

Technical flaws
 - 

Comparison to other work
- Relation to ontology explanation: Justifications = conflict sets, entailments = observation, repair = diagnosis

Relevance to your work
-

What questions does it raise?
- DLs not mentioned (but generalisation approach indicates that conclusions also hold for DLs, also due to the fact that DLs are a fragment of FOL)

	Abstract = {The claim that scientific explanation is deductive has been attacked on both systematic and historical grounds. This paper briefly defends the claim against the systematic attack. Essential to this defence is a distinction between perfect and imperfect explanation. This distinction is then used to illuminate the differences and similarities between Aristotelian (anthropomorphic) explanations of certain facts and those of classical mechanics. In particular, it is argued that when one attempts to fit classical mechanics into the Aristotelian framework the latter becomes structurally incoherent. It is suggested that this, together with the fact that classical mechanics embodied the first piece of perfect knowledge, accounts, in part at least, for the historical fact of the rapid demise of the Aristotelian patterns as the new science developed. On the basis of this discussion, the inadequacies of the attack on the deductive model on historical grounds by Toulmin come to be seen.},

	Annote = {Problem statement /Motivation
- Most OWL ontologies on the web are OWL Full, mainly due to "errors"
- OWL DL is desirable, as it offers sound and complete decision procedures (important for tools)
- Analysis which ontologies are OWL Full because of required expressivity, or only due to modelling errors

Background
-

Key ideas / Methodology
- Propose parsers that can fix ("patch") ontologies to produce OWL DL where possible
- obtain ontologies from DAML library (based on OWL namespace) and google, 201 in total
- Analysis of different reasons (20 different, 5 categories) why ontology is OWL Full, namely:
1) Missing type information - most common (property not specified to be a dataype or object property)
2) Namespace problems
3) Wrong vocabulary (misuse of owl:sameAs instead of equivalentClass, xml:base and xmlns confusion)
4) OWL Full expressivity
5) OWL/RDF Irregularities
- types of errors: external (triples correspond to OWL, but higher expressivity) / internal (RDF graph incorrectly formed) / syntactic errors

Technical contribution
- Methods for patching: add triples (considered safe due to monotonicity of RDF entailment), "remove" triples (i.e. tell reasoner to ignore imports, re-interpret sameAs etc)

Conclusion / Evaluation
- Majority of ontologies is OWL Full, can be converted into OWL DL by applying patching methods

Technical flaws
 - 

Comparison to other work
- Web ontology landscape -> Collection of ontologies (less sources)

	Annote = {Problem statement /Motivation
- domain: conjuncitve query answering in ontology-based data access (OBDA)
- justification of presence of tuples in answers non-trivial --> explanation needed
- explanation in DL Lite reasoning:
1) requires inference rules for building proofs
2) find short proofs

Background
- query answering generalizes instance checking

Key ideas / Methodology
- explanation corresponds to formal proof
- proof & rules of inference have desired properties to support understandability:
  - simplicity
  - brevity
- eliminiate trivial proofs, but find shortest non-trivial proofs
- replace certain assertions with new operators (e.g. disjoint(A,B) instead of A sub  -B, add domain(), range(), eliminate role inverses from GCI etc)
- looks for evidence of KB unsatisfiability, different from diagnosing errors (pinpointing etc)
- give user option to see enumeration of different explanations
- generate proof tree of atoms in query
	
Technical contribution
- alternate (shorter) syntax for DL Lite introduced
- algorithm for finding shortest proofs of inconsistency
- explanation of reasoning in finite models (relevant for conceptual models of databases)
- implementation in prototype Prolog program that finds (minimal length) explanation for query answers

Conclusion / Evaluation
- introduction of shorter syntax could be helpful
- no user evaluation of usefulness of developed method and algorithms

Technical flaws
 - 

Comparison to other work
- different approach then most pinpointing methods
- based on logical proofs

Relevance to your work
-

What questions does it raise?
- Future work: Explanation why certain value is NOT returned by query

- opinion paper
- overview over application of model-based diagnosis (mainly in automotive domain)

Background
- MBD proposed in early 80s to overcome limitatioons of traditional expert systems
- theory of MBD: diagnosis should be based on objective model of device (system) to be diagnoses
- different types of models: structural, functional, behavioral, teleological
- models should be 1) reusable 2) compositional
- device (system) is described in terms of its minimal replaceable or repairable components
- model may be quantitative / qualitative, dynamic / static, crisp / probabilistic
- diagnostic problem: observed behaviour of a system is not in accordance with expected behaviour
- different notions of explanation (i.e. which components of the system are faulty)

Key ideas / Methodology
- statement: MBD is ready for applicatons
- MBD applied in many different fields (technical systems, medical diagnosis, automotive domain, aerospace)
- used in industry for "physical" systems and devices of different scale (circuits, gas turbines), adapted for purpose of ontology explanation

Technical contribution
- overview of applications of MBD in different areas of industry

Conclusion / Evaluation
- 

Technical flaws
 - 

Comparison to other work
- Reiter's HST algorithm is method of MDB

Relevance to your work
- good overview over application, but not directly relevant

What questions does it raise?
- Advantage over other approaches?

- Automatic proof checking systems should certify correctness of inference that is "obvious" to the user
- typical FOL proof for inference long and difficult to understand 
- optimised FOL proof still large
- we need a class of "obvious" inferences 

Background
- theorem proving
- FOL proof procedures
- Herbrand proofs

Key ideas / Methodology
- based on nonresolution Herbrand theorem proving procedure
- COMPLICTAED inference: requires multiple substitutions from (typically infinite) Herbrand universe in same clause 
	--> this makes it difficult to find the right substitutions in order to minimise the number of inference steps
- OBVIOUS inference: Herbrand proof of correctness involves no more than one substitution instance of each clause
- automating obvious inference to use in resolution theorem prover that verifies obvious inferences: based on method of "linked conjuncts"
	--> Set of clauses which is minimally truth-functionally unsatisfiable must be linked
	--> "Linked": Negation of each literal occurring in one of the clauses (in a satisfiable subset of the set of clauses) 
		must occur in one of the remaining clauses (when added to this subset we get the the minimally unsatisfiable set)
	--> Use unification algorithm to search for possible matches between literals and their negations using a single copy of each clause

Technical contribution
- mechanism that can be implemented as inference rule in natural deduction systems
- reduces number of inference steps
- algorithm for new inference rule "OBVIOUS" to be added to natural deduction proofcheckers

Conclusion / Evaluation
- experiments with theorem prover (in LISP)
- results: lengths of proofs were shortened by factor of approx 10

Technical flaws
 - 

Comparison to other work
- 

Relevance to your work
- "Obvious inferences" relevant for lemma generation with justifications

What questions does it raise?
- is it now standard in theorem provers?

- system description of semantic web search engine
- discovers and indexes RDF and OWL documents
- computes a rank

Background
-

Key ideas / Methodology
- based on crawler
- architecture:
a) discovery layer: crawler collects candidate URLs -> caches documents
b) metadata creation: generates metadata (syntax + semantics)
c) data analysis: derives analytical reports from documents and metadata (classification, rank, IR inded
d) interface
- crawlers use heuristics to find documents
a) google crawler (type extensions, different keywords for more specific queries, combine results)
b) focused crawler to find documents within a given website (extension constraints)
c) submission of ontologies
d) Swoogle crawler (crawl found documents, URIref namespace is likely to be a document, owl:import,  rdfs:seeAlso)
- metadata
a) basic metadata of individual docs (encoding, language, owl type, ontology ratio, annotations)
instance vs class data
b) relations between docs (see paper)
c) analytical results, e.g. ranking

	Annote = {Problem statement /Motivation
- current visualization techniques limited wrt scalability
- visualization of 1 million items - make them effectively visible and manageable on a screen
- no use of aggregation techniques
- interactive techniques applied to treemaps and scatter plot diagrams

Background
- strong interaction component of existing visualizations allows users to explore data
- current vis. systems limited to 10.000 items (size, speed, slow graphics libraries)
- possible application: usage patterns of books in library, examination of databases of highway incidents etc

Key ideas / Methodology
- visualization techniques rely on:
1) hardware acceleration (interaction and animation performance)
2) stereovision, transparency, synthetic overlap (to enhance visualization)
3) animation, interaction while replaying recorded views (visualization configurations) -> analyze data across several views
- represent items using scatter plots and tree maps
- focus on pre-attentive processing: information can be recognized "at a glance"
- relies heavily on hardware acceleration

Technical contribution
- developed system to display 1 million items on 1600x1200 display, without aggregation
- designed new animation techniques, use transparency and stereovision for termporary inspections
- dynamic queries possible

Conclusion / Evaluation
- testing only on small scale
- more experiments needed

Technical flaws
 - 

Comparison to other work
- 

Relevance to your work
- visualization of large structures could be applied to vis of large ontologies?

What questions does it raise?

	Annote = {Problem statement /Motivation
- ontology languages based on DLs do not provide the expressive power to represent axiom negations
- propose general framework accounting for inconsistency, negation and change
- inconsistency and negations closely related to ontology change

Background
- reasoning with inconsistent ontologies: entailment explosion
- AGM theory of belief change based on coherence model (both explicit and implicit knowledge are of equal value, should be considered when making changes in the KB) - here, the foundational model is used (changes can only be made in explicit knowledge)
- 3 different operators:
1) expansion
2) revision
3) contraction
- negated axioms one of the key stones connecting contraction and revision operators in AGM theory

Key ideas / Methodology
- based on AGM theory of belief change

Technical contribution
- propose two corresponding axiom negations
1) consistency-negation of axiom
2) coherence-negation of an axiom
- set of postulates that follow the AGM principles of 1) existence and 2) rationality
- set of postulates for revision

Conclusion / Evaluation
- proposed negations can be used to achieve Harper identiy and Levi identity for ontology change
- allows to make a close connection between ontology revision and contraction operations

Technical flaws
 -

- 

Relevance to your work
- models of incoherence vs inconsistency relevant for proof

	Annote = {Problem statement /Motivation
- analyse methods of ontology evaluation wrt integration into a single evaluation framework
- set up formal model for ontology based on meta-ontology O2 and ontology of ont evaluation and validation oQual

Background
- semiotic object: object constituted by
- information object
- intended conceptualization established within a communication setting

Key ideas / Methodology
- meta-ontology O2 characterizes ontologies as semiotic (interpreted as signs rather than semantic!?) objects
- oQual provides quality-parameters and ordering functions - modelled as diagnostic task over ontology elements, processes and attributes
- three main types of measures for ontology evaluation
1) structural measures (i.e. graph based measures)
2) functional measures (main purpose of ontology, measure against expert's judgement)
3) usability-related measures (communication context of ontology, recognition, efficiency, interfacing)

Technical contribution
- framework (not implemented) based on two ontologies that measure and evaluate an ontology, O2 and oQual

Conclusion / Evaluation
- 

Technical flaws
- no suggestion how evaluation could be implemented and presented to the user
- general application?

- evaluate KB systems based on LUBM benchmark
- 4 different systems tested
- focus on large OWL apps
- test main-memory based vs secondary storage (DB) based systems

Background
- no previous evaluations carried out
- scalability vs reasoning capacities

Key ideas / Methodology
- use LUBM benchmark with test ontology (university) + set of queries
- develop combined metric that ranks system based on response time, answer soundness, completeness

Technical contribution
- application of LUBM benchmark
- benchmark results
- combined metric for benchmark

Conclusion / Evaluation
- benchmark results depend on storage, scalability of system, reasoning capacities

Technical flaws
- no detailed analysis of reasons for results (e.g. slight alterations of test parameters etc) - only asumptions
- compared systems slightly different

Comparison to other work
- 

Relevance to your work
- introduction of combined metric interesting wrt "measuring" justificatory structure
- methodoloy for experiments
- overview of KB systems helpful (Sesame, OWLJessKB, DLDB-OWL, KAON, Jena)

What questions does it raise?

	Year = {2010},
	Annote = {Problem statement /Motivation
- discuss and define different types of masking of justifications in OWL ont
- masking: number of justifications for entailment does not match the number of reasons why entailment holds
- masking occurs within a just., over a set of just., over a set of just. and axioms outside just.
- problems: 1) affects understanding 2) affects repair plan

Background
- potential superfluity of axioms in justifications causes problems -> parts of axioms are not required for entailment
- focuses on OWL 2
- structural transformation used for laconic just.

Key ideas / Methodology
- Different types of masking:
1) internal masking - within 1 just.
2) cross masking - within a set of just.
3) external masking - parts from regular just. + parts from other axioms from the ontology
4) shared core masking - laconic versions of two just. are equal
- detecting masking: preferred laconic just. - laconic j that are made up of axioms which come from a filter on deducitve closure of set of axioms (filer O+)

Technical contribution
- definition of different types of masking
- method to detect masking: identify parts of axioms in just, weaken parts, look for number of laconic just. that are present

Conclusion / Evaluation
- feasible to detect internal and cross masking
-  incremental techniques could make detecting external masking feasible
- internal masking not present within laconic justification

Technical flaws
 - 

Comparison to other work
- fine grained / laconic just discussed in ISW08 paper

Relevance to your work
- masking relevant wrt root / derived, just. structure (differences between regular + laconic just.)

What questions does it raise?
- performance, scalability (structural transformation must be computed)

- Little kown about justifications for inconsistent ontologies (here: OWL 2)
- Reasoners  only state "inconsistent", no explanation (Only Pellet reasoner provides clash information)
- How can we deal with / explain inconsistency to help with debugging?

Background
- Two ways of dealing with inconsistent ontologies: 
1) paraconsistent reasoning
2) repair --> discussed in this paper

Key ideas / Methodology
- Computing all justifications: Use "seed" for HST algorithm, i.e. select axioms based on signature of entailments
--> Not possible for inconsistent ontologies --> Use all axioms in ontology for expansion phase
- Size of hitting set exponential in the size of explanations (worst case)
- Large number of justifications for inconsistent ontologies cannot be dealt with

Technical contribution
- Algorithm to compute all justifications for inconsistent ontologies
- Tests with reasoners (HermiT, Pellet, FaCT++)

Conclusion / Evaluation
- Computing a single justification is feasible (and already useful)
- Computing all justifications for inconsistent ontologies is not possible for some ontologies, due to large number of justifications
- Caused by ABox --> number of justifications increases for each instance of an unsatisfiable class
- Results of tests: consistency check very efficient, computing at least 1 justification possible within 10 seconds

Technical flaws
 - 

Comparison to other work
- Uses Reiter's HST algorithm (diagnosis = repair, minimal conflict sets = justifications)

Relevance to your work

What questions does it raise?
- How can we deal with inconsistent ontologies? Is there a good way of producing explanations?},

	Abstract = {A justification for an entailment in an OWL ontology is a minimal subset of the ontology that is sufficient for that entailment to hold. Since justifications respect the syntactic form of axioms in an ontology, they are usually neither syntactically nor semantically minimal. This paper presents two new subclasses of justifications---laconic justifications and precise justifications. Laconic justifications only consist of axioms that do not contain any superfluous '' parts''. Precise justifications can be derived from laconic justifications and are characterised by the fact that they consist of flat, small axioms, which facilitate the generation of semantically minimal repairs. Formal definitions for both types of justification are presented. In contrast to previous work in this area, these definitions make it clear as to what exactly '' parts of axioms'' are. In order to demonstrate the practicability of computing laconic, and hence precise justifications, an algorithm is provided and results from an empirical evaluation carried out on several published ontologies are presented. The evaluation showed that laconic/precise justifications can be computed in a reasonable time for entailments in a range of ontologies that vary in size and complexity. It was found that in half of the ontologies sampled there were entailments that had more laconic/precise justifications than regular justifications. More surprisingly it was observed that for some ontologies there were fewer laconic justifications than regular justifications.},
	Annote = {Problem statement /Motivation
- justifications for entailments in OWL ontologies are not minimal (syntax and semantics)
- formal definitions (what are "parts of axioms" that lead to an entailment) and methods needed to produce "fine grained" j

Background
-

Key ideas / Methodology
- introduce "laconic" and "precise" justifications and provide an algorithm that computes them
- use a black box algorithm to incrementally compute all laconic justifications for an entailment
- implementation uses Pellet reasoner and OWL API

Technical contribution
- definition of laconic justifications: do not contain any superfluous parts (only removal of parts of axioms)
- defines the length of an axiom? (been done before?)
- definition of precise justifications: derived from laconic j, contain only "flat" axioms (weakened) -> useful for semantically minimal repair
- algorithm to compute laconic / precise j
- discusses internal / external masking and their effects on understanding j
- empirical evaluation of methods to find laconic / precise j

Conclusion / Evaluation
- relations between number of regular j and laconic / precise j for an entailment unclear?
- laconic justifications are important to reveal masking effects and common corse of different justifications
- computing laconic justifications has worse performance than computing regular j

Technical flaws
 - 

Comparison to other work
- formal definitions of superfluous parts to produce fine grained j
- defines what "parts of axioms" that are responsible for an entailment to hold are, not depending on a particular implementation

Relevance to your work
-

What questions does it raise?
- how to deal with inconsistent ontologies?
- how are the laconic and precise j presented in tools?

	Abstract = {In this paper we propose a hypothesis-driven design of the
empirical analysis of different decision procedures which we refer to 
as \emph{scientific benchmarking}.  The approach is to start by 
choosing the benchmark problems for which, on the basis of analytical 
considerations, we expect a particular decision procedure to exhibit a 
behaviour different from another decision procedure.  Then empirical 
tests are performed in order to verify the particular hypothesis 
concerning the decision procedures under consideration.  As a case 
study, we apply this methodology to compare different decision 
procedures for propositional temporal logic.  We define two classes of 
randomly generated temporal logic formulae which we use to investigate 
the behaviour of two tableaux-based temporal logic approaches using 
the Logics Workbench, a third tableaux-based approach using the 
\textsl{STeP} system, and temporal resolution using a new prover 
called \textsl{TRP}.}}

- Finding all justifications for OWL entailments is more difficult than finding only one j
- 

Background
- practical explanation services needed
- Reiter's hitting set tree (HST) algorithm provides way of dynamically computing justifications

Key ideas / Methodology
- black box (reasoner independent) and glass box (reasoner dependent) strategies to compute justifications for OWL entailments
- entailment check can be reduced to satisfiability check: O entails A SubclassOf B iff A And Not(B) SubclassOf Bottom
- main goal of optimisations of algorithm: reduce number of satisfiability checks
- glass box: satisfiability test while computing j is as easy as performing satisfiability test alone --> tracing in reasoner
- glass box: optimisations of reasoner must be turned off in order to find all possible clashes
- explains relation between justifications and Reiter's hitting set tree algorithm
- optimisations: 1) early path termination 2) Reusing justifications

Technical contribution
- algorithms: two-stage black box technique and hybrid (gb+bb) solution to compute all j
- main component of algorithm: recursive procedure that traveses a HST

Conclusion / Evaluation
- tests: 14 ontologies
- single justifications: excellent performance of glass box (1ms)
- all justifications: glass box performed better (but both are below one second)
- conclusion that black box performance is sufficient for tasks
- "reasoner independent techniques for finding all justifications for an OWL-DL entailment are practical"

Technical flaws
 - 

Comparison to other work
- HST

Relevance to your work

What questions does it raise?
- optimisations?
- is the performance of black box really sufficient?

- extends WWW05 / JWS05 paper
- repair unsat. concepts
- repair strategies, rank erroneous axioms
- suggest appropriate axiom edits (rewrite axioms)

Background
- root/derived unsat classes
- lack of automated repair processes
- axiom pinpointing (Schlobach) works only for less expressive DL, less fine granularity, no axiom ranking

Key ideas / Methodology
- find parts of axioms that cause errors -> fine grained
- modify HST alg to find parts of axioms that are relevant
- MUPS -> "precise" MUPS -> split axioms in small parts -> find MUPS in split version of KB
- ranking: preserve highest ranked axioms, based on:
	1) arity
	2) impact of axiom
	3) user specified test cases
	4) provenance information
	5) syntactic relevance

Technical contribution
- interactive explanation + repair suite in SWOOP
1) ranking of axioms in MUPS wrt repair
2) modification of HST algorithm based on axiom ranking
3) previse MUPS -> strike out irrelevant parts of axioms in UI
4) suggest axiom rewrites

Conclusion / Evaluation
- pilot study (12 subjects) - improvement over previous work
- extensive debugging + repair support (root/derived, precise MUPS, rewriting axioms)
- basis for end-to-end framework for debugging

Technical flaws
 -

- inconsistencies in OWL ontologies
- not clear which axioms or parts of axioms can be selected for repair

Background
- existing approaches: 
	- minimal unsatisfiable sub-ontologies (see MUPS) 
	- and maximally satisfiable sub-ontologies (Meyer et al, 2006)

Key ideas / Methodology
- aim: minimise impact of repair on ontology
- calculate lost entailments of concepts when removing axioms for repair
- suggest harmful and helpful  (wrt a concept in a  problematic axiom) repair
- algorithm for ALC based on Meyer's tableau tracing algorithm to trace which parts of axioms cause unsatisfiability
- algorithm captures concept parts that cause a clash in the tableau

Technical contribution
- definitions of "harmful" and "helpful" repair
- implement interactive debugging tool
- test on two ontologies (1 toy, 1 real life)
- arity of a concept in an axiom: number of times that concept appears in a clash
- impact of removal: 1) other satisfiable concepts may lose entailments 2) unsatisfiable concept may lose entailments that are not relevant to repair

Conclusion / Evaluation
- test results show feasibility, performance ~27 seconds for real life ontology

Technical flaws
 - SLOW!

Comparison to other work
- MUPS
- fine-grained (which parts of axioms are responsible for unsatisfiability) --> precise and laconic justifications

Relevance to your work
- tableau different from justifications
- "helpful" and "harmful" repair relevant (--> root unsatisfiable classes recommended with justifications approach)

What questions does it raise?
- omptimisations and limitations of algorithm?

- generate proofs for unsatisfiability of CNF formulas
- identify minimal unsatisfiable cores = MIPS for the formula
- side remark: minimum INCONSISTENT kernel not adressed yet (2004)

Background
- CNF formula is unsatisfiable if it is possible to generate an empty clause by resolution from original clauses
-> unsat. core = set of original clauses used for deriving empty clause
- there may exist many different unatisfiable cores (-> multiple explanations)
- related work: extracting unsat. cores based on conflict analysis procedure

Key ideas / Methodology
- propose algorithm for computing minimum unsat cores
- SAT based algoirhtm

Technical contribution

Conclusion / Evaluation
- results limited to formulas with small number of variables and clauses

	Title = {Finding maximally satisfiable terminologies for the description logic $\mathcal{ALC}$},
	Year = {2006},
	Annote = {Problem statement /Motivation
- support for resolving errors in ALC Tboxes

Background
- two main approaches to resolving errors
1) identify sources of error and leave it to modeller to fix it --> pinpointing of problematic statements
2) suggest possible resolutions to problem (weaken available information to extent that errors are eliminated)
- SAT in ALC is PSPACE-complete

Key ideas / Methodology
- calculate A-MSSs (maximally A-satisfiable subsets - raltes to single concept) and MCSSs (relates to entire terminology)
- algorithm generates tableau tree 
--> does not close branch when clash occurs, but breaks clashes by excluding axioms (new non-deterministic rule)

Technical contribution
- tableau procedure for finding maximally concept-satisfiable terminologies in ALC
- algorithm can also be applied to identify A-MCSS
- implementation in Java without optimisations, uses only ordering heuristics (no existing reasoners)

Conclusion / Evaluation
- experiments with 3 ontologies - faster than using FaCT++ as black box to find A-MSS (e.g. 7 seconds for DICE)
- future work: Adapt algorithm to compute MUPS and compare with algorithm in Schlobach&Cornet 2003


Technical flaws
- algorithm does not guarantee that every leaf node corresponds to an A-MSS
- can only handle unfoldable TBoxes

Comparison to other work
- close to Schlobach's work that finds A-MUPS of TBox:
subsets of bottom obtained by excluding minimal hitting sets (Schlobach) are A-MSS of bottom

Relevance to your work
- relevant wrt repair

- find errors in ontologies
- improve debugging for OWL ontologies
- integrate debugging support in SWOOP
- diagnosis and correction of unsatisfiable concepts

Background


Key ideas / Methodology
- support understanding and repairing errors -> based on justifications
- investigate black box and glass box algorithms, based on DL tableau reasoner (Pellet)
- detect unsatisfiable concepts that depend on other unsatisfiable concepts (root/derived)
- uses dependency directed backjumping for tableau reasoner in order to determine which classes reveal the inconsistency -> optimisation!
- glass box: add data structures to reasoner to track source of clash
- black box: disable absorption optimisation makes computing support sets easier

Technical contribution
- debug mode for SWOOP, using information from reasoner that points out causes for unsatisfiable concepts
- description of UI features that improve the tool's usability, such as hypertext navigation
- repair support in SWOOP (uses versioning feature) makes "experimenting" with changes easier and safer

Conclusion / Evaluation
- Problem: Non-local effects of complex constructs in highly expressive DLs
- Suggestions on how to diagnose inconsistent KBs
- positive reactions from users
- focuses on user interaction rather than technical details
- high level

Technical flaws
 - 

Comparison to other work
- less specific than Schl03 for example

Relevance to your work
- mentions root/derived
- lists causes for inconsistency

What questions does it raise?
- more detailed description of algorithms used to produce explanations?

	Annote = {Problem statement /Motivation
- Debugging services in ontology tools lack sufficient support
- Debugging time consuming
- Catalogue of common antipatterns (errors) found in inconsistent ontologies can assist debugging process

Background
- Generation of explanations for inconsistency takes up to several hours
- domain experts change axioms randomly to correct error
- intended meaning can also be changed instead of correcting errors in formalisations

Key ideas / Methodology
- Classification of design antipatterns:

1) Logical Anti-patterns --> can be detected by DL reasoner
- AndIsOr: And / or do not correspond to conj./disj.
- OnlynessIsLoneliness: Universal quantifiers over disjoint fillers
- UniversalExistence:  Universal vs existential quantifier over disjoint fillers
- EquivalenceIsDifference: Equivalence (instead of subsumption) of disjoint classes

2) Non-logical (cognitive) anti-pattern --> possible modelling errors due to misunderstanding of logical expression
- SynonymeOfEquivalence: Equivalence is used to express terminological synonymy relation
- SumOfSome: Similar to Onlyness but existential quantifiers
- SomeMeansAtLeastOne: Superfluous >=1 cardinality restriction

3) Guidelines --> expressions correct, but there exist simpler alternatives
- DisjointnessOfComplement: Equivalence with complement used instead of disjointness
- Domain&CardinalityConstraints: Superfluous combination of existential and cardinality restriction
- GroupAxioms: Easier to group all restrictions of a class in a single restriction

Technical contribution
- List of antipatterns that cause large number of inconsistency in ontologies
- Antipatterns that don't cause logical errors but are mostly modelling errors

Conclusion / Evaluation
- 

Technical flaws
 - 

Comparison to other work
- similar findings in Bechofer&Volz 2004

Relevance to your work
- useful for identifying common errors, could be used to suggest repair methods 

What questions does it raise?
- how can the non-logical errors be identified?
- how can we be certain that there exists a modelling error and the use of the pattern is not intentional?

	Annote = {Problem statement /Motivation
- qualitative analysis of using pinpointing for debugging support and clarification
- apply to incoherence as a) intrinsic feature of ontology b) result of merging ontologies

Background
- semantic clarification: automatically enrich ontologies with disjointness statements

Key ideas / Methodology
- core: set of axioms occurring in several incoherent sub-TBoxes
- the more MIPS a core belongs to, the more likely it is that the axioms in it are the cause of contradictions
-> look for cores with maximal arity (i.e. occur in the most MIPS)
- algorithms for finding MIPS, MUPS and cores restricted to unfoldable ALC Tboxes
AND cores restricted to SIZE 1

Technical contribution
- strategy for debugging of incoherence in merged ontologies
- strategy for semantic clarification
- empirical results

Conclusion / Evaluation
1) size of ontology relevant for clarification?
--> no (example)
2) are disjointness statements useful for users?
--> can be useful if user has domain knowledge to make exceptions for disjointness explicit
3) does clarification help debugging?
--> ?


Technical flaws / limitations
- restricted to unfoldable ALC TBoxes
- cores restricted to size 1 because exponentially many checks would be required for larger cores
--> we can solve this with the FCA algorithm
- some limitations to clarification, as it depends on expert knowledge

Comparison to other work
- clarification = similar to ontology completion (add disjointness statements instead of concept definitions and instances as counter-examples, but basically the same and not contradicting)
 
Relevance to your work
- core problem!

What questions does it raise?

	Year = {2005},
	Annote = {Problem statement /Motivation
- diagnostic support for debugging terminologies

Background
- incoherence often result of migrating or merging ontologies
- HST is created breadth first
- Satisfiability of terminologies is not preserved directly when translated into FOL
--> introduce expectations E --> concept A satisfiable wrt T if T U E satisfiable
--> diagnosis problem occurs when terminological system description is unsatisfiable wrt set of expectations
- diagnoses and MIPS (MUPS) are complementary for debugging

Key ideas / Methodology
- Framework for debugging of logically contradicting terminologies
- adapts Reiter's HST algorithm and applies it in three different scenarios:
1) DL reasoning system as black-box to compute maximal conflict sets
--> expressiveness of terminologies that can be degugged is only restricted by expressiveness that reasoner can handle
2) non-optimised DL reasoning engine (own implementation) to compute small conflict sets (derived from clashes in tableau)
reasoner returns (not minimal) list of axioms that are (indirectly) responsible for a clash
--> size of HST decreases compared to method 1
3) specialised algorithm to determine minimal conflict sets (based on ScCo03)

Technical contribution
- 

Conclusion / Evaluation
- Analysis of three different approaches
- relatively poor experimental results 
- Approach 1 works only for very small examples - complexity is too high, conflict sets are "huge", HST too large to handle
--> complexity caused by the fact that constructing minimal hitting sets from MIPs corresponds to calculating prime implicants for a propositional formula
- at least small conflict sets are required to produce some diagnoses

Technical flaws
 - Improvements necessary: improve HST implementation and tableau calculus of adapted DL-engine
- Alternative approach to compute MIPS:
create sub-TBoxes of increasing size and check for correctness using a standard reasoner 
--> Similar to expansion phase when creating justifications?

Comparison to other work
- Criticises ScCo03: restricted to ALC, no further analysis of minimal sub-terminologies for further information on which of the axioms should be ignored or fixed

- DICE terminology (2400 concepts) development prone to errors
- need support for debugging in order to understand modelling errors (logical contradictions)

Background
- DICE based on ALC terminology

Key ideas / Methodology
- Explain modelling errors through (axiom / concept) pinpointing -> identify axioms that are relevant for debugging
- algorithm to compute MUPS based on Boolean minimisation of terminological azioms needed to close a standard tableau
- Explanation of the error and correction

Technical contribution
- 

Conclusion / Evaluation
- no concrete definition of how GITS are "most likely to be useful" 
- implemented algorithm finds MUPS for all but 7 (out of ca 750 in DICE) unsatisfiable concepts, runtime 40 minutes (1GHz pentium in 2003...)
- unsatisfiability checking takes most of the time
- only based on ALC terminologies, no work for more expressive DLs

Technical flaws
 - 

Comparison to other work
- MUPS similar to justifications
- also introduces "concept pinpointing" -> syntactically minmal GITs are most useful for identification of errors -> similar to fine grained justifications
- algorithm to find minimal GITs is similar to contradiction / expansion method used to find justifications

Relevance to your work
-

What questions does it raise?
- investigate more expressive DLs than ALC
- more testing results than DICE
- optimisation of implementation

	Title = {Explaining User Errors in Knowledge Base Completion},
	Year = {2008},
	Annote = {Problem statement /Motivation
- KB completion (based on FCA methods) can cause false entailment (consequence) if user makes wrong decision
- pinpoint errors, i.e. find minimal explanation for the error

Background
- KB completion methods using FCA (attribute exploration), as proposed previously
- explanation / pinpointing of axioms that cause error during completion process

Key ideas / Methodology
- KB has static part (original TBox) and refutable part (axioms that are added during the completion process) 
- it is assumed that errors (and explanations) only come from the refutable part and that the static part is correct
- details of attribute exploration algorithm for completion: algorithm does NOT enumerate ALL implications, but produces them in lexicographical order such that minimum number of implication questions is asked.
- DUQUENNE GUIGUES BASE contains smallest number of implications (out of sets of implications that have the same consequences)
- set of axioms in refutable part of TBox form Duquenne Guigues Base (see Lemma 2)

Technical contribution
- complexity results (and proofs):
a) deciding whether minimal explanation exists: NP-complete
b) counting minimal explanation sets: #P complete (proof: bijection hitting sets / minimal explanations -> same complexity for counting)
- algoritm that computes 1 minimal explanation by performing at most polynomially many subsumption tests (simple contraction strategy, no expansion phase, i.e. start with the whole TBox)
- experimental tool INSTEXP
- HST algorithm is NP-complete

Conclusion / Evaluation
- algorithm for finding 1 explanation is straightforward

Technical flaws
 - 

Comparison to other work
- algorithm for finding is simple expansion/contraction without the expansion

- survey of FCA+DL approaches

Background
- FCA: closed world
- DL: open world assumption

Key ideas / Methodology
- two streams
1) enrich FCA with constructors from DL
2) use FCA methods to solve problems in representing knowledge with DLs
- regarding 2)
a) (Baader) FCA for efficient computation of extended subsumption hierarchy: not only atomic concepts, but conjunctions (A and B -> C)
--> runtime inferences for individuals can be made faster by precomputing hierarchy for conjunctions of concepts
b) extension of a) with disjunctions (Stumme)
c) subsumption hierarchy of least common subsumers -> bottom up construction of knowledge, semi-automated: give typical examples of a concept, system computes potential definition of concept
d) relational exploration (Rudolph): refining DL KBs, obtain complete knowledge about subsumption relationships in KB -> RELEXO tool
e) finite model exploration in \mathcal{EL} (Baader, Distel)
f) bottom-up construction of ontologies (Sertkaya): uses most specific concepts / least common subsumer. Limitation: least common consumer can only be computed for inexpressive DLs -> use 'background terminology' in expressive DL and add inexpressive statements bottom-up.
Use attribute exploration method to compute smallest conjunction (used to compute 'good' common subsumer, gcs)
g) ontology completion (Sertkaya): 
use FCA algorithm to ask questions to add definitions for incompletely defined concepts and individuals as counter-examples -> ONTOCOMP tool
partial concept / partial object description (pod) is a tuple that represents attributes which are known to hold / not hold for an object. 
Undecided implication = implication that does not follow from a set of implications, but is not refuted by a partial context.
--> find all undecided implications (efficiently) and enumerate.

- study users of information visualisation systems - assess creativeness of tools and work processes
- document 1) usage of the tool and 2) success in achieving the user's goals through using the tool

Background
- ethnographic observation
- creativity support tools

Key ideas / Methodology
- Multi-dimensional: various methods (observations, interviews, surveys, automated logging)
- in-depth: intense engagement of researchers with users
- long-term: longitudinal study (weeks, months)
- case studies: small number of individuals
- users work in their normal environment (not a lab)

Technical contribution
- MILC guidelines:
	- specify research questions and goals
	- identify 3-5 users
	- document current method or tool
	- determine what would constitute success for the user (goals)
	- schedule of observations and interviews
	- tool records usage data (e.g. features used)
	- provide log book to users for recording comments
	- provide training
	- conduct visits and interviews
	- encourage users to continue using best possible tool (not only the new tool)
	- modify tools as needed
	- document success and failures

Conclusion / Evaluation
- Outcome of MILCs: 1) information about and refinement of tool 2) expert user achieves goals
- MILCs provide multiple perspectives on tool usage

Technical flaws
 - 

Comparison to other work
- 

Relevance to your work
- user study will be necessary when developing any new interaction mechanisms

What questions does it raise?
- Compare usefulness / success of study with other approaches?

- Systematic analysis and evalutation of ontology debugging tools based on eight test cases

Background
-

Key ideas / Methodology
- Test for unsatisfiability (can be detected at all?), inconsistency and incoherence
- use ontologies of different sizes and complexity (eight test cases)
- systems checked: MUPSter, DION, RADON, Protege, SWOOP

Technical contribution
- analysis of limitations of debugging tools
- benchmark test set consists of ontologies that have inconsistencies produced by automatic matching systems

Conclusion / Evaluation
- relatively negative conclusion - completeness, correctness and minimality of results insufficient
- some tools have performance problems
- conclusion: further develop glass-box (here: white-box) approaches and specialised debugging tools

Technical flaws
 - too much "guessing" which reasons cause problems

Comparison to other work
- from 2008, so debugging in Protege improved (based on laconic and precise justfications that have a formal definition)
- conclusion orthogonal to HoPa09b (black-box vs glass-box), due to performance issues

Relevance to your work
-

What questions does it raise?
- "kinds of axioms" - expressivity
- explain interaction mechanisms and computation of explanation

	Year = {2008},
	Annote = {Problem statement /Motivation
- justifications for an entailments in ontologies aids debugging
- optimisations needed

Background
- relevance based algorithm for finding justifications by Ji, Qui, Haase
- modularity
- subsumption module: module that preserves (covers) all subsumptions for concepts in the signature that defines a module
- strong subsumption module: also covers all justifications for all subsumptions
- algorithm based on Reiter's HST algorithm - compute one justification as root for the HST

Key ideas / Methodology
- use modularisation as optimisation technique for algorithm to find all justifications for an entailment
- extract locality based module for concept in entailment and perform j. finding algorithm --> reduces search space and number of SAT checks

Technical contribution
- modularisation based algorithm
- proof that modularisation with locality based modules preserves justifications: - every minimal locality based module is a subsumption module


Conclusion / Evaluation
- test with 3 ontologies (GALEN, Gene Ontology, NCI)
- algorithm based on modularization considerably faster than standard HST based and relevance based algorithms (less than 50% of the time)

Technical flaws
 - 

Comparison to other work
- Modularisation mentioned as optimisation technique in "Justifications in OWL" (HoPa09)

Relevance to your work
- optimisation to speed up justification finding

What questions does it raise?
- has property of "strong subsumption modules" for locality based modules been mentioned elsewhere before?

	Annote = {Problem statement /Motivation
- metrics do not take semantics of ontology language into account
- create metric that is stable wrt syntax through normalization

Background
- most metrics based on structural notions, don't take semantics into account --> imcomparable measurement results
- structural metrics are graph metrics
- don't take open world assumption into account

Key ideas / Methodology
- normalization in 5 steps:
1) name anonymous classes  (no anonymous complex class descriptions left)
2) name anonymous individuals
3) materialize subsumption hierarchy + unify names
4) propagate instances to deepst possible class or property within hierarchy
5) normalize property instances
- metrics are stable with regards to possible addtions of further axioms!
- normalization does not lead to canonic normalized version - different ontologies result from normalization of ontology
- take open world assumption into account when defining metric

Technical contribution
- normalization process that preserves all possible models
- normalized and original version are semantically equivalent
- examples of differences between metrics for ontology vs normalized ontology

Conclusion / Evaluation
- normalization leads to more intuitive results for metrics
- some metrics do NOT work with normalization

Technical flaws
 - more examples / test results would be helpful

Comparison to other work
- 

Relevance to your work
- discussion of "measuring entailments" - infinite number of statements are entailed
	- only terminating measures are relevant
- discussion of redundancy
	- example for redundancy
- normalization can be used for other metrics as well - normalize justifications?

What questions does it raise?

- evaluate trends in modeling practices, OWL construct usage and different types of OWL

Background
-

Key ideas / Methodology
- statistical survey to assess different aspects OWL and RDFS ontologies
- methodology for collecting data: search Swoogle, Google
- use repositories: Protege OWL library, DAML Ontology Library, Open Biological Ontologies repository, SchemaWeb
- pruning method: no "toy" ontologies (only realistic ones), duplicates, outdated URIs
- 4 reasons that make an OWL ont OWL Full: 
syntactic OWL Full, Redefinition of Built-In Vocabulary, Mixing Classes, Properties and Individuals, Need for Beyond OWL DL

Technical contribution
- statistics: "dynamic" (change with inferred hierarchy) and "static" attributes of ontologies
- comparison of asserted and inferred graph structure (morphology) - increasing / descreasing graph complexity
- tool artefacts (Protege) cause usage of "union"
- methodology to collect ontologies

Conclusion / Evaluation
- only very little inconsistent ontologies, mostly due to syntactic errors
- figures on OWL expressiveness: majority is OWL Full, but can be easily patched to OWL DL and OWL Lite
- majority only very weak expressivity (AL)
- only 1/3 of ontologies contain instances

Technical flaws
 - 

Comparison to other work
- Bechofer / Volz use patching method
- Stuckenschmidt's test corpus?

Relevance to your work
-

What questions does it raise?
- more precise description / comparison of different types of ontologies
- propose classification

Ideally an ontology is a common denominator for user profiles and document's metadata. Hierarchical ontologies are flexible in that document's metadata may have different granularity compared to user profile. This means that they may be defined on different levels of the hierarchy. This in turn makes the matching of document metadata and user profiles more complex. In this paper we describe the CoMet System, and in particular how the matching problem is solved. 1},

	Abstract = {With the advent of Semantic Web languages such as OWL (Web Ontology Language), the expressive Description Logic SHOIN is exposed to a wider audience of ontology users and developers. As an increasingly large number of OWL ontologies become available on the Semantic Web and the descriptions in the ontologies become more complicated, finding the cause of errors becomes an extremely hard task even for experts. The problem is worse for newcomers to OWL who have little or no experience with DL-based knowledge representation. Existing ontology development environments, in conjunction with a reasoner, provide some limited debugging support, however this is restricted to merely reporting errors in the ontology, whereas bug diagnosis and resolution is usually left to the user.},

	Year = {2008},
	Annote = {Problem statement /Motivation
- Large number of justifications difficult to deal with
- focus on RELEVANT justifications only
- use a relevance based selection function

Background
- algorithm restricted to unsatisfiable concepts
- any entailment can be reduced to concept unsatisfiability
- in expressive DLs such as SHOIN(D), for every axiom entailed by O, there is always a concept C subClassOf nothing

Key ideas / Methodology
- use syntactic relevance-based selection function that selects subset of ontology
- relevance of axiom: relevant to O if it is directly relevant to some other axiom in the ontology (i.e. they share individual, role or concept names)
- introduce relevance-based selection function and ordering to find relevant justifications 
(i.e. justs that contain relevant axioms)
- justifications get "relevance degree"
- if relevant justifications wrt a concept unsatisfiability are t o be found, then select AXIOMS that are more relevant to the concept in order to compute justifications
- justs found correspond to hitting sets for set of all justifications

Technical contribution
- introduce relevance-based selection function and ordering to find relevant justifications 
(i.e. justs that contain relevant axioms)
- algorithm to find ALL justifications - either ALL or ALL RELEVANT ones
- experiments measured against KaPaHo07 ISWC paper results

Conclusion / Evaluation
- algorithm is faster than previous results - generates FEWER justifications 
- more efficient than HST based one
- sometimes set of axioms that are relevant to entailment is expanded very fast using the relevance-based selection function

Technical flaws
 - 

Comparison to other work
- 

Relevance to your work
- method of COPING with multiple justifications - relevant when comparing with EXPLOITATION (just. structure)
- but doesn't find ALL justs which are relevant for just. structure
- good counter example!!

What questions does it raise?

	Year = {2006},
	Annote = {Problem statement /Motivation
- support for inconsistencies in ontologies
- approach to rank and rewrite axioms --> guidelines for users how to repair the ontology
- focus on ALC ontologies

Background
- inconsistent ontology: O has no model
- incoherent ontology: O contains unsatisfiable named concept
- two existing approaches:
1) pinpoint MUPS
--> pinpointing algorithms as additional functionality to external DL reasoner
2) calculate MCSSs (Maximally Concept-Satisfiable Sub-Ontologies) - Meyer 2006
--> obtain satisfiable sub-ontologies by removing enough axioms to eliminate all errors
--> believed to have better scalability
--> used as basis for ranking and rewriting suggestions
- all direct siblings in a well-defined subsumption hierarchy should be disjoint

Key ideas / Methodology
- ranking to indicate likely correctness of an axiom
--> knowledge heuristics based on 1) ontology structure 2) patterns of usage of the ontology
- "confidence" of axiom: function that ranks axiom between -1 (incorrect) and 1 (correct), default is 0
- syntactic relevance:
	--> concepts are relevant to each other if they appear on LHS and RHS of the same axiom, relation is transitive (but relevance decreases with length of chain)
- sibling concepts: if axiom relates C to relation R and C's siblings are also related to R, then a's confidence value is higher
- usage heuristics: 
	- use log file to gatehr information about user interaction with ontology
	- user inputs reliability values (reliability of sources)
--> compute confidence for usage heuristics: time since last modification (newer is more reliable), reliability value of source, number of modifications
- axioms in justification can be revised (weakened) so that contradiction is removed
--> make RHS more general
--> or make LHS more specific

Technical contribution
- methods to compute the "confidence" of an axiom, suggests which axioms should be repaired to yield a consistent ontology
- strategies to rewrite an axiom through generalisation or specification in order to repair the error

Conclusion / Evaluation
- approach to suggesting revision of axioms that are responsible for unsatisfiable classes rather than just removing them
- no implementation, no test of usefulness

- tool support for ontology comprehension 

Background
- model exploration, based on J. Bauer's work

Key ideas / Methodology
- visualise how concepts in an ontology are related to each other
- use graph structure: nodes = concepts, edges = subsumption or existential relationship
- user chooses two concepts, system displays their relationship

Technical contribution
- path simplicity ratio - ratio of path length between asserted concepts to path length between inferred concepts
- plug-in for Protege that shows relationships as graphs

Conclusion / Evaluation
- visual representation of relationships between two concepts in ontology beneficial to user
- path simplicity ratio indicates how relationship between concepts changes between asserted and inferred class hierarchy

Technical flaws
 - fairly trivial
- statement that "understanding the most complex concepts leads to understanding the entire ontology" not sound

- comparison to SuperModel - displays concepts rather than individuals in the model
