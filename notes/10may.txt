It's only the 10th today, turns out my watch has got the wrong date on it. I've been massively confused all week, seriously!!

Anyway, so what am I going to write about today? Maybe think a little more about the related work bit. Currently my related work section looks like this:
\section{Explanation in Description Logic Knowledge Bases}

\section{Ontology Metrics}
\section{Root- and Derived Justifications}
\section{Masking}
\section{Proofs and Lemmas}
\section{Unification and Matching}
\section{Cognitive Complexity}

And I honestly don't like writing related work, but I suppose I'll have to.

The first section will be about explanation in general, i.e. first a section on justification-based debugging/repair - start with McGuinness, then mainly Schlobach, Parsia, Kalyanpur, and the whole pinpointing work by Baader and Penaloza. 
This should also include a subsection on 'computing justifications' I suppose?  
Then I discuss other (more recent) approaches to debugging, e.g. Nadeschda's repair tool, Scharrenbach, and the belief revision based on.
With the justification-based approaches, I am trying to illustrate how there have been many approaches for computing justifications, but only one has made it into a tool so far.
I might leave out the 'metrics' section as this is not my main focus. There is a huge body of work for metrics, so discussing it would be quite a big job - I could mention some entailment/axiomatic richness related papers I suppose for the entailment section!
The next step after justifications (with focus on computing) then is work that has been done in *understanding* justifications or supporting working with justificaitons, i.e. root and derived, laconic and precise --> user-interaction/user-experience/reducing effort approaches

the plan would look like this
explanation
	justification based approaches
		computing
		understanding
			laconic/precise
			masking
			root/derived
			proofs/lemmas
			cognitive complexity
	other explanation 
 
Then I will have to try and fit cognitive aspects somehow?
Unification and matching is syntactical (i.e. similarity of concepts?), but I consider it from a cognitive point of view. Why do I discuss unification/matching? To show that there has already been the idea of isomorphism/subexpression-isomorphism, for a different purpose (what is the purpose of it anyway?), but it hasn't been applied to cognitive issues. (find out where u/m has been applied in general?)

Have cognitive stuff separate - what's the purpose of the section? It's not really related work as in applied to OWL/DL ontologies (I might have a look and see if there has been any work done re: cognitive issues of description logics), but  an example of cognitive analysis that has been performed in other areas, but not OWL.
I generally want to discuss the background on cognitive complexity of logics/KR formalisms, but I'm not sure where to put it.
