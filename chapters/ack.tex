I would like to thank my supervisors Bijan Parsia and Uli Sattler for their support, enthusiasm, and incredible patience with me throughout this PhD. I would also like to thank the \emph{DL-istas} in the IMG and BHIG for their ideas and the many interesting ad-hoc discussions in our office, in particular Colin Puleston who dedicated his time to saving my broken code. And finally, I want to thank my family who have been so supportive over the course of my seemingly never-ending studies.
